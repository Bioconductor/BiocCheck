#' Unload a package
#'
#' This function attempts to cleanly unload a package, including unloading
#' it's namespace, deleting S4 class definitions and unloading any loaded
#' DLLs. Unfortunately S4 classes are not really designed to be cleanly
#' unloaded, and so we have to manually modify the class dependency graph in
#' order for it to work - this works on the cases for which we have tested
#' but there may be others.  Similarly, automated DLL unloading is best tested
#' for simple scenarios (particularly with \code{useDynLib(pkgname)} and may
#' fail in other cases. If you do encounter a failure, please file a bug report
#' at \url{http://github.com/hadley/devtools/issues}.
