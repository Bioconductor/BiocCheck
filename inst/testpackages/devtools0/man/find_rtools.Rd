\title{Find rtools.}
\usage{
find_rtools(debug = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{debug}{if \code{TRUE} prints a lot of additional
  information to help in debugging.}
}
\value{
Either a visible \code{TRUE} if rtools is found, or an
invisible \code{FALSE} with a diagnostic
\code{\link{message}}.  As a side-effect the internal
package variable \code{rtools_path} is updated to the paths
to rtools binaries.
}
\description{
To build binary packages on windows, Rtools (found at
\url{http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/}) needs
to be on the path. The default installation process does
not add it, so this script finds it (looking first on the
path, then in the registry). It also checks that the
version of rtools matches the version of R.
