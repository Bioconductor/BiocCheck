build_win(pkg = ".", version = "R-release", quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{pkg}{package description, can be path or package
  name.  See \code{\link{as.package}} for more information}

  \item{version}{directory to upload to on the win-builder,
  controlling which version of R is used to build the
  package. Possible options are listed on
  \url{http://win-builder.r-project.org/}. Defaults to the
  released version of R.}

  \item{quiet}{if \code{TRUE} suppresses output from this

\description{
This function works by bundling source package, and then
uploading to \url{http://win-builder.r-project.org/}.  Once
building is complete you'll receive a link to the built
package in the email address listed in the maintainer
field.  It usually takes around 30 minutes. As a side
effect, win-build also runs \code{R CMD check} on the
package, so \code{build_win} is also useful to check that
your package is ok on windows.
