  \item{pkg}{package description, can be path or package
  name.  See \code{\link{as.package}} for more information}
}
\description{
This is an environment like \code{<package:pkg>}. The
package environment contains the exported objects from a
package. It is attached, so it is an ancestor of
\code{R_GlobalEnv}.
}
\details{
When a package is loaded the normal way, using
\code{\link{library}}, this environment contains only the
exported objects from the namespace. However, when loaded
with \code{\link{load_all}}, this environment will contain
all the objects from the namespace, unless \code{load_all}
is used with \code{export_all=FALSE}.

If the package is not attached, this function returns
\code{NULL}.
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{ns_env}} for the namespace environment that all
the objects (exported and not exported).

\code{\link{imports_env}} for the environment that contains
imported objects for the package.
