\description{
Builds package vignettes using the same algorithm that
\code{R CMD build} does. This means includes non-Sweave
vignettes, using make files (if present), and copying over
extra files. You need to ensure that these files are not
included in the built package - ideally they should not be
checked into source, or at least excluded with
\code{.Rbuildignore}
