+ description namespace consistency  (??? look at FIXME in code ???) 

+ Coding Practice
   - print(), cat() usage outside show and print method
   - message(), warning(), error() not with paste except collapse
   - if/while () & vs &&, | vs || ? (if/while/etc...  should be || / &&  not single) 
   - ??Make sure every (non-trivial) class has a show() method or at least display the #/% of classes that don't.

+ man page checks
   - check usage/% of dontrun/dontcheck (NOTE)

+ NEWS 
   o formatting  (??? needs work ???)

+ unit test coverage amount?
