\item{BiocVersion}{ The version of Bioconductor }
\item{Package}{ The name of the package in check }
\item{PackageVersion}{ The version of the package in check }
\item{sourceDir}{ The directory of the package source or tarball in check }
\item{installDir}{ The directory where the package is installed for
testing, a temporary location by default
}
\item{BiocCheckDir}{ The directory where the \verb{<package>.BiocCheck} folder
is saved. Usually the same folder as the package in check }
\item{platform}{ The platform/OS where the check is taking place }
\item{isTarBall}{ Whether the package in check is a source directory or a
